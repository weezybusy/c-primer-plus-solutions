/*
 * 13.8.c -- Write a program that takes as command-line arguments:
 * a character and zero or more filenames. If no arguments follow
 * the character, have the program read the standard input. Otherwise,
 * have it open each file in turn and report how many times the
 * character appears in each file. The filename and the character
 * itself should be reported along with the count. Include error-
 * checking to see whether the number of arguments is correct and
 * whether the files can be opened. If a file canâ€™t be opened, have
 * the program report that fact and go on to the next file.
